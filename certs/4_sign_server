Using the CSR, the CA (really using the CA key and certificate) creates the signed certificate:

openssl x509 \
  -req \
  -in server.csr \
  -CA ca.crt \
  -CAkey ca.key \
  -CAcreateserial \
  -days 365 \
  -out server.crt


the CAcreateserial option that manages a newly created file, ca.srl, that enables each certificate 
created by this CA to have a unique serial number.
