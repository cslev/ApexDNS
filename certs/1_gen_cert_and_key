openssl req \
  -new \
  -x509 \
  -nodes \
  -days 365 \
  -subj '/CN=my-ca' \
  -keyout ca.key \
  -out ca.crt

This outputs two files, ca.key and ca.crt, in the PEM format (base64 encoding of the private key and X.509 certificate respectively).

Looking at the openssl req documentation, we see that the -new and -x509 options enable the creation of a self-signed 
root CA X.509 certificate. 
The nodes (No DES) option disables securing the private key with a pass-code; this option is optional. 
The subj option provides the CA’s identity; in this case the Common Name (CN) of my-ca. 
The remaining options are self-explanatory.
