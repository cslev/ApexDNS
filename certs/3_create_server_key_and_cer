openssl genrsa \
  -out server.key 2048

Remember, our goal here is to create a server certificate for the DNS name localhost signed by the CA. 
We now create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) with the Common Name (CN) localhost:

openssl req \
  -new \
  -key server.key \
  -subj '/CN=localhost' \
  -out server.csr
