We essentially repeat the process to create the client’s key and certificate; starting by creating the client’s key:

openssl genrsa \
  -out client.key 2048


Creating the CSR with the arbitrary Common Name of my-client:

openssl req \
  -new \
  -key client.key \
  -subj '/CN=my-client' \
  -out client.csr

And finally the creating the client’s certificate:

openssl x509 \
  -req \
  -in client.csr \
  -CA ca.crt \
  -CAkey ca.key \
  -CAcreateserial \
  -days 365 \
  -out client.crt

note: If you inspect this certificate, you will observe that the Serial Number is indeed different than the server’s certificate.

One observation is that both the server and client certificates are simpler X.509 v1 certificates; 
the CA certificate however is a X.509 v3 certificate. 
This is because OpenSSL automatically creates X.508 v3 self-signed certificates (CA certificate) and we did not supply 
any v3 extensions when signing the server and client certificates (using the extfile and extensions options).

note: The use of various X.509 v3 extensions is outside the scope of this article; besides I have not found any 
simple explanations of them myself.
