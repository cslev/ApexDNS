We can turn-around and inspect the certificate using the following command:

openssl x509 \
  --in ca.crt \
  -text \
  --noout



Both the Subject and Issuer have the value CN = my-ca; this indicates that this certificate is self-signed

The Validity indicates that the certificate is valid for a year

The X509v3 Basic Constraints value CA:TRUE indicate that this certificate can be used as a CA, 
i.e., can be used to sign certificates
